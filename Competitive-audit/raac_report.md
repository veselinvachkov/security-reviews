## Title Unsafe ERC20 Transfers: Vulnerability in Deposit and Withdraw Functions

## Summary

The codebase contains a vulnerability in the deposit and withdraw functions related to `ERC20` token transfers. The implementation directly calls transferFrom and transfer without using `safeTransferFrom` or `safeTransfer`, which can lead to inconsistencies if the `ERC20` token returns false instead of reverting on failure. This could result in incorrect updates to `_balances` and `_totalValue`, leading to potential loss of funds or incorrect accounting within the contract.

## Vulnerability Details

The key issue lies in the way ERC20 token transfers are handled:

```solidity
    function deposit(address token, uint256 amount) external override nonReentrant {
        if (token == address(0)) revert InvalidAddress();
        if (amount == 0) revert InvalidAmount();
        
        //@audit use safeTransferFrom
        IERC20(token).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
        _balances[token] += amount;
        _totalValue += amount;
        
        emit Deposited(token, amount);
    }
```

```solidity
    function withdraw(
        address token,
        uint256 amount,
        address recipient
    ) external override nonReentrant onlyRole(MANAGER_ROLE) {
        if (token == address(0)) revert InvalidAddress();
        if (recipient == address(0)) revert InvalidRecipient();
        if (_balances[token] < amount) revert InsufficientBalance();
        
        _balances[token] -= amount;
        _totalValue -= amount;
        //@audit use safeTransfer
        IERC20(token).transfer(recipient, amount);
        
        emit Withdrawn(token, amount, recipient);
    }
```

Many ERC20 tokens adhere to the OpenZeppelin standard, where `transferFrom` and `transfer` revert on failure. However, some tokens return false instead of reverting. The current implementation does not check for a return value, which means that if a token fails to transfer, `_balances` and `_totalValue` will still be updated incorrectly. This could create an accounting discrepancy and potential loss of funds.

## Impact

* If a token returns false on failure instead of reverting, `_balances` and `_totalValue` will be updated despite the transfer not actually succeeding.

* This could lead to incorrect balances being reflected in the contract, causing overstatements of funds held in the treasury.

* A malicious actor could exploit this by depositing a token that does not revert on failure and then withdrawing more than they should be entitled to.

* Any token relying on false return (standard ERC20) values instead of reverts could cause silent failures, leading to unexpected behavior.

You can add this test function to your test file located in 2025-02-raac/test/unit/core/collectors/Treasury.test.js

```solidity
    describe("SafeERC20 Transfers", () => {
        let failingToken;

        beforeEach(async () => {
            // Deploy a mock token that returns false instead of reverting
            const FailingToken = await ethers.getContractFactory("FailingToken");
            failingToken = await FailingToken.deploy("Failing Token", "FAIL", 18);
            await failingToken.mint(user1.address, ethers.parseEther("1000"));
        });

        it("should revert when deposit fails due to token returning false", async () => {
            await failingToken.connect(user1).approve(treasury.getAddress(), ethers.parseEther("100"));
            await expect(
                treasury.connect(user1).deposit(failingToken.getAddress(), ethers.parseEther("100"))
            ).to.be.revertedWith("SafeERC20: ERC20 operation did not succeed");
        });

        it("should revert when withdrawal fails due to token returning false", async () => {
            // Approve and deposit valid token to ensure there are funds in the contract
            await token.connect(user1).approve(treasury.getAddress(), ethers.parseEther("100"));
            await treasury.connect(user1).deposit(token.getAddress(), ethers.parseEther("100"));

            // Replace the token in contract balance mapping (mocking a scenario where it holds a failing token)
            await ethers.provider.send("hardhat_setStorageAt", [
                treasury.getAddress(),
                ethers.utils.keccak256(ethers.utils.defaultAbiCoder.encode(["address"], [failingToken.getAddress()])),
                ethers.utils.hexZeroPad(ethers.utils.hexlify(ethers.parseEther("100")), 32)
            ]);

            await expect(
                treasury.connect(manager).withdraw(failingToken.getAddress(), ethers.parseEther("50"), user2.address)
            ).to.be.revertedWith("SafeERC20: ERC20 operation did not succeed");
        });
    });
```

## Tools Used

Manual review.

## Recommendations

To prevent this vulnerability, use OpenZeppelinâ€™s SafeERC20 library, which ensures that failed transfers revert instead of returning false. The correct implementation should be:

```solidity
import { SafeERC20 } from "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol";

using SafeERC20 for IERC20;

IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);

IERC20(token).safeTransfer(recipient, amount);
```

This approach guarantees that the contract correctly handles token transfer failures, preventing incorrect balance updates and potential fund losses.
